## Inspiration
As Binghamton students, we need time to relax and socialize after a week of hard work. Thatâ€™s why we wanted to create a user-friendly application that is easy to use, allowing students to both find events and schedule them. In addition, clubs can post their own events, to make hosting them for their targeted audience easier. Users can also use the application to find professional events that are being hosted.

## What it does
An app to schedule or host events by adding pins onto a map. The map is interactive, allowing users to find locations and data about those locations. We've also integrated an AI chatbot to filter events catered to users We hope that Binghamton students and clubs can use this to make hosting and starting events easier!

## How we built it
Using the React library, Firebase for backend services, with Tailwind CSS for our frontend.

## Challenges we ran into
We found the development of the chatbot and utilization of the google maps API to be difficult.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud about the UI and how we integrated all of the components of our tech-stack to create a smooth and functioning application.

## What we learned
We became more familiar with the languages and technologies in our tech stack.

## What's next for B-Scene
We could expand our project to focus on other parts of the world, like being able to select different colleges or even cities. We also plan to make many quality-of-life improvements, including more events, more filters/pins, and improved recommendations from the chatbot.
